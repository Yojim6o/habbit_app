# The Habit App (WIP)

The Habit App is a work in progress application designed to help you build and track your progress in habit formations over both short and long periods of time (5 days to 1 year).

###Idealogy###

Someone who wants to form a habit should not be derailed by less-than-perfect performance.  This application will utilize a scoring system to focus/track user improvement.

###Environment Setup###

```
	> git clone git@github.com:Yojim6o/habit_app.git
	> cd habit_app
	> npm install
	> npm start
```

When ready, visit [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

###How to use###

Within the browser, you should see a list of habits.  You can click on one to view its details and user score in the habit details section.

(More features to come)

###Road Map###

- Move model to a database
- Build habit creator
- Scale scorecard model
- Create user environment
- Create habit categories and scoring weights
- User interactions/accountability features
- Achievements
- Styling/branding
- More to come!...
